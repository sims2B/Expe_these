The first table describes the results without any cuts and the second
one presents the results with the preemptive cuts,
i.e. $z_{ie}+z_{if}-z_{ig} \le 1, \ e<f<g$. For both table, the first
column stands for the instance size, the second and third ones
describe when the first solution is found and the gap of this
solution.  The other columns present the time needed to solve the
instance (if solved optimally), the percentage of instances solved
optimally and the root gap. For the second table, the last column
shows the number of cuts.
